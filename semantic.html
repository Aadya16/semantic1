                <center><h2>Facts About Cricket World Cup</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Cricket World Cup (officially known as ICC Men's Cricket World Cup) is the international
                        championship of One Day
                        International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the
                        International Cricket Council
                        (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals
                        tournament. The tournament is one
                        of the world's most viewed sporting events and considered the "flagship event of the
                        international cricket calendar" by
                        the ICC.The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.
                        However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed
                        regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889. Representative cricket
                        teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic
                        sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal. This was the only
                        appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.
                        
                        The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament
                        played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was
                        not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and crowd attendances
                        were poor, attributed to a "surfeit of cricket". Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised
                        as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship
                        in 1999.
                        
                        The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928,
                        New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be
                        played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.</p>
                        
                     <p>In the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one
                        day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup, and continuing with
                        the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed
                        in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England
                        and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a
                        forty over game with eight balls per over. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in
                        England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider
                        organizing a Cricket World Cup.India and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The
                        games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the
                        Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in
                        the final, the closest margin in the World Cup final until the 2019 edition between England and New Zealand.
                        
                        The 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing,
                        white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team
                        participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the
                        international sports boycott. Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22
                        runs in the final and emerge as winners.
                        
                        The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for
                        some of its group stage matches. In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden
                        Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default
                        after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance. Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden
                        championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.

                    <p>The first Cricket World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket
                        match having been played
                        only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years
                        before the first men's
                        tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as
                        1912, when a triangular
                        tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first
                        three World Cups were held
                        in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an
                        unofficial rotation
                        system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.</p>
